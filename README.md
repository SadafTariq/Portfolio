# [Vivendo Food Claims Case Study](https://github.com/SadafTariq/VivendoFoodClaims)

This is a project I did for my DataCamp's Data Analyst(Associate) Certification, where I answered a number business questions

- Data is taken from vivendo food claim dataset(the dataset was provided by datacamp)
- Data Validation and data cleaning tasks are done before analysis
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization is done to defend the analysis
- A report is generated and is published on datacamp's workspace
